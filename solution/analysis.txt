How my code is different from the solution

My code uses semantic sections (<header>, <section>, <footer>) , but the solution adds class names like .profile and .skills to target sections more specifically with CSS.
I placed the image outside the "About Me" section, while the solution nests the image within a profile section to group related content.
My design is simple and minimal, with cursive fonts and centered text.
The solution adds layout enhancements: background colors for sections, rounded borders, padding, and a fixed footer. These create clearer visual structure and a more modern look.
I used element selectors (like h1, p, ul, li), which apply styles broadly.
The solution uses class selectors (.profile, .skills), giving more flexibility for styling individual parts of the page.
The solution also demonstrates CSS positioning (position: fixed) for the footer and border-radius for rounded corners.
I used cursive fonts throughout; the solution uses a sans-serif font (Arial) for cleaner readability and consistency.
The solution adds spacing and margins to separate content sections, improving overall layout and balance.

What the Solution Code Adds to My Learning or Understanding

It shows how adding class attributes gives more control over specific page sections, rather than styling all elements of a type the same way.
The solution illustrates how color contrast, padding, and rounded corners can make a page more professional and visually appealing.
Using margins, padding, and fixed positioning improves how elements appear on different screen sizes and maintains structure as the user scrolls.
The clean and organized CSS (using logical class names and grouped styles) makes future edits easier.
